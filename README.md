# FxSound

FxSound is a digital audio program built for Windows PC's. The background processing, built on a high-fidelity audio engine, acts as a sort of digital soundcard for your system. This means that your signals will have the clean passthrough when FxSound is active. There are active effects for shaping and boosting your sound's volume, timbre, and equalization included on top of this clean processing, allowing you to customize and enhance your sound.

## Build Instructions
### Prerequisites
* Download and install the [latest version of FxSound](https://download.fxsound.com/fxsoundlatest)
* Install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs)
* Install [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk)
* Install [JUCE framework version 6.1.6](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/releases/tag/6.1.6)

FxSound application requires FxSound Audio Enhancer virtual audio driver. So, to run FxSound application built from source, we need to install FxSound which installs the audio driver.
To build x64/x86 and ARM64 from a common project, from FxSound version 1.1.34.0, the project is upgraded to JUCE 8.
Note: While building with JUCE 7.x.x version we ran into an issue that the application CPU utilisation goes high when the display is off. So, we were building FxSound versions 1.1.31.0 or older with JUCE 6.1.6.

### Build FxSound from Visual Studio
* Open [fxsound/Project/FxSound.sln](https://github.com/fxsound2/fxsound-app/blob/main/fxsound/Project/FxSound.sln) in Visual Studio
* Build the required configuration and platform and run

### Build after exporting the project form Projucer
FxSound application has three components. 
1. FxSound GUI application which uses JUCE framework
2. Audiopassthru module which is used by the application to interact with the audio devices
3. DfxDsp module which is the DSP for processing audio

Due to the some limitations with Projucer, after exporting the Visual Studio solution from Projucer, few changes have to be made in the solution to build FxSound.
1. Since the audiopassthru and DfxDsp dependency projects cannot be added to the solution when FxSound.sln is exported, open fxsound/Project/FxSound.sln in Visual Studio and add the existing projects audiopassthru/audiopassthru.vcxproj, dsp/DfxDsp.vcxproj.
2. From FxSound_App project, add reference to audiopassthru and DfxDsp.
3. If you run FxSound from Visual Studio, to let the application to use the presets, set the Working Directory to ```$(SolutionDir)..\..\bin\$(PlatformTarget)``` in FxSound_App Project->Properties->Debugging setting.
